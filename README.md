# 🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis 
 
 Task 05

This project involves the analysis of US traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. 
The goal is to identify accident hotspots and understand the factors contributing to road accidents.

📌 Objective

Analyze traffic accident data from the United States.

Identify patterns associated with:

Road conditions

Weather

Time of day


Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using data analysis and visualization tools.


📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:

🔗 US Traffic Accident Data – Kaggle Notebook

The dataset contains detailed information about accidents that occurred in the US, including geographic location, weather conditions, visibility, and more.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization Libraries

Geospatial Visualization (optional for maps)


📊 Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand structure and trends.

Correlation analysis between accident frequency and environmental/temporal factors.

Visual representation of:

Accident density heatmaps

Impact of weather on accident severity

Time-of-day analysis


Identification of high-risk zones and times.
